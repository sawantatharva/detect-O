# Detect'O
- A course project developed with a focus to build an experimental setup for persistent pipe monitoring robot that detects leaks in underground water pipes.
- Installed acoustic sensors & endoscopic camera inside to locate & determine the cause of the leaks.
- Gathered data from the setup, which had frequency: 850-950 Hz, compared to normal: 770 Hz to train ML models. 
- Used the compiled data to train machine-learning models to help detect leaks in underground water pipes.
- Tools Used: Sensor Fusion, Arduino, Python, TensorFlow, Figma
- **Team Members:** Atharva Sawant, Hriday Rathi, Khushi Goel, Priyanshu Singhal & Rahath Malladi
